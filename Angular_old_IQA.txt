1. What is CSS Float Property?
The float property specifies how an element should float.
 
2. What is CSS Position?
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).
 
3. HTML5 Semantic Web?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
 
4. Difference b/w local storage and session storage
Session storage is temporary which exists as long as the current window is opened and data gets lost when window 
is closed, where as Local Storage is persistant and remains intact across sessions unless anyone deletes it.
 
5.What is Javascript function?
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.
Particular business logic called as function. 
 
6.What is the scope of the variable?
Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.
 
In JavaScript there are two types of scope:
 
Local scope
Global scope
JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
 
Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.
 
Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
 
7. What is Callback, closure?
Passing "one function" to "another function" as an argument called as "CallBack".
if any inner function accessing the outer function data, then such scenario called as closure.
 
 
8.explain crud operations in angular?
CRUD operations in Angular refer to the four basic functions for managing data: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
Create
Creating new data involves sending a POST request to the server API. In Angular, this is typically done using the HttpClient service.


9.why we use bootstrap? explain some bootstrap class?
Bootstrap is a framework to help you design websites faster and easier. 
It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, 
modals, image carousels, etc. It also gives you support for JavaScript plugins.  
 
10.explain directives
To enhance view capabilities or view features we go for directives. 
Types of Directives – 2 types 
Predefined Directives --- Directives given by the Angular framework 
Custom Directives --- Directives developed by users
 
11.explain routing?  Navigating from 1 component to another component is called routing. 
 
12.Events in HTMl?
HTML has the ability to let events trigger actions in a browser, like starting a JavaScript when a user clicks on an element.
 
 
13.differnce between display:block and visibility hidden?
display:none will hide the element and collapse the space is was taking up, 
whereas visibility:hidden will hide the element and preserve the elements space.
 
14.difference between var, let, const keyword?
 
                             var                                         let 
 
    1) ES1                                                          1) ES6 
    2) duplicate variables allowed                                  2) duplicate variables not allowed 
    3) won't obey scope rule                                        3) obeys scope rule 
    4) global polluting issue raised                                4) we can overcome global polluting issue
    5) variable hoisting raised                                     5) we can overcome variable hoisting  
    6) var keyword is the global scope                              6) let keyword is the block scoped member 
       member 
//const keyword 
 
//const keyword used to declare the variables 
 
//const keyword introduced in "ES6" 
 
//in const keyword "reinitialization" not possible 
  
15.types of Binding in angular?
There are four different types of ways through which we can do data bindings in Angular 2 namely 
event binding, 
unidirectional binding (i.e. one-way binding), 
bi-directional binding (i.e. two-way binding), 
and the interpolation.
 
 
16.Lifecycle hooks in Angular?
 
ngOnChanges: Called every time a data-bound input property changes. 
It’s called a first time before the ngOnInit hook. The hook receives a SimpleChanges object that contains the previous and current values for the data-bound inputs properties. This hook gets called often, so it’s a good idea to limit the amount of processing it does.
 
ngOnInit: Called once upon initialization of the component.
 
ngDoCheck: Use this hook instead of ngOnChanges for changes that Angular doesn’t detect. It gets called at every change detection cycle, so keeping what it does to a minimum is important for performance.
 
ngAfterContentInit: Called after content is projected in the component.
 
ngAfterContentChecked: Called after the projected content is checked.
 
ngAfterViewInit: Called after a component’s view or child view is initialized.
 
ngAfterViewChecked: Called after a component’s view or child view is checked.
 
ngOnDestroy: Called once when the component is destroyed and a good hook to use to cleanup and unsubscribe from observables.
 
 
 
17.differnce between promise and observable?
 
Promises Establishes the communication between "producer" and "consumer". 
       - Promises also called as "special javascript objects". 
       - we will create Promises by using "Promise" class constructor. 
        - Promises have 3 states 
            1) success  (resolve) 
            2) error    (reject) 
            3) pending 
          - we will consume promises by using "then()" 
 
a Promise is always asynchronous,
while an Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous,
a Promise can provide a single value,
whereas an Observable is a stream of values (from 0 to multiple values), 
you can apply RxJS operators to an Observable to get a new tailored stream
